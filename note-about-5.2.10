Weird patching issue occurring on my machine.

Hunk #2 for /sound/usb/mixer.c applies with fuzz. Upon inspection, the patch is applied twice around line 748. After
popping the quilt back to 5.2.9, only one copy is removed. However, after manually removing the duplicate and pushing
5.2.10, it's the normal patch and it persists. 

YMMV, I've added the 5.2.10 version of mixer.c in case anybody (or myself) needs it.

+       if (desc->bLength < sizeof(*desc) + desc->bNrInPins)
+               return -EINVAL;


What was used:
quilt 0.66
fresh tarball from kernel.org
GCC 9.2.0

In any case, I've compiled and booted without issue, including signed external modules.
